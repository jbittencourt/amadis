AMADIS
======

AMADIS was a research project developed from 2002 to 2008 by the Cognitive Studies Laboratory - LEC < http://www.lec.ufrgs.br >  and it's partners. Its goal was to investigate and develop software for Distance Learning  which privileged construction of knowledge by exploring the possibilities of Internet as a new media. Since its inception, the project developed several different software tools for distance learning, experimenting with different models of connecting students.

AMADIS is also the name of the main software developed by the project, which is a Virtual Learning Environment - VLE. VLEs are software for learning management that summarize the features of computer mediated communication (e-mail, notice boards, newsgroups, etc.) and methods for online availability of teaching materials.

The main innovation of AMADIS was to its design as a VLE for Project Based Learning - PBL, specially for the Learning Projects PBL proposal. Thus, it differs from most existing virtual environments, which are intended only to courses and the publication of teaching materials, being a literal transpositions of the traditional school structure. AMADIS was built to provide autonomy for students and spaces for development of projects.

In 2007 and 2008, AMADIS was adapted as a tool to support primary education classrooms, and was used by several one laptop per child projects in Brazil.

TECHNOLOGY
==========

AMADIS was developed in PHP 4.2 and later ported to PHP 5. It used an in-house framework, called CM->Devel, for template management and as object-relation wrapper. This was a pre-mvc era, when most frameworks were still being imagined.
